    <p class="heading">Investing as a minor</p>
    <p class="text">Have you seen any news about kids making thousands of dollars by simply investing in a business, and
        how people have made over 6x their money worth in 1 year of Tesla? Have you ever thought “How can I make a lot
        of money by doing the least amount of effort?”. Well, investing is a great way to make that money that you have
        wanted whether it is used to buy your first car, or if it is to buy the newest thing that everyone is talking
        about. This website will teach you the basics of investing to hopefully get you more interested in
        investing.</p>

    <p class="heading">What is investing</p>
    <p class="text">In simple terms investing is the act of buying a share of a company, and letting them share grow
        with you, or in a bad case, fall with you. Stocks fluctuate based on the company earnings and assets. Stocks can
        also go up based on rumors or assumptions based on the company. An example of a rumor affecting a stock is with
        the Company Churchill Capital Corp IV (CCIV) as they were rumored to merge with a car manufacturer.</p>

    <p class="heading">How you can start investing</p>
    <p class="text">If you want to start investing as a minor it won’t be as easy as making a normal account by
        yourself. If you are under the age of 18, you have to open a custodial account. A custodial account is not
        anything special, but you need to sign up under your parent’s name. Personally, I use a website called
        Wealthsimple, it is simple to use and is well known in Canada. Wealthsimple allows you to put money into your
        account and use it whenever you want.</p>
    <p class="heading">An important tip to help you get started</p>
    <p class="text">If you want to start investing but your parents don't trust or want you to start trading money right
        away paper trading is a great idea to help you learn more about investing. Paper trading is almost exactly like
        normal investing but instead of real money, you use fake money. Most paper trading websites move with the actual
        stock market so your prices will be exactly the same as what it would be like to invest in the actual stock
        market.</p>
